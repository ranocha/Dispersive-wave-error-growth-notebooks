> We study the numerical error in solitary wave solutions of nonlinear dispersive wave equations. A number of existing results for particular equations and/or methods indicate that the error grows quadratically in time for numerical methods that do not conserve energy, but grows only linearly for conservative methods. We provide numerical experiments indicating that this result extends to a very broad class of equations and numerical methods.

The numerical experiments were carried out on a workstation running Kubuntu 20.04.
The Jupyter notebooks running Julia kernels used Julia v1.5.3.
